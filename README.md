# excel2dict
Advanced parser for multi dimensional tables/dictionaries from excel to python data structure
Have you seen this use case? And had to parse this type of excel yourself?

Table
_______________________________________
Row1               Row2
Column1   Value11   Column1   Value12
Column2   Value21   Column2   Value22
Column3   Value31   Column3   Value32
Column4   Value41   Column4   Value42
Column5   Value51   Column5   Value52
Column6   Value61   Column6   Value62

Supports parsing by position.
Supports complex formulae to skip rows, jump to cells.

You can parse a crazily nested excel file into a simple python data structure using a data dictionary!!
